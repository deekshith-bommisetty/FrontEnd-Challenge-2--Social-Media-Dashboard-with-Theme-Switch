# Front End Challenge - Social Media Dashboard with Theme Switch

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges allow you to improve your skills in a real-life workflow.

**Social Media Dashboard** challenge is a static responsive webiste developed using using HTML, CSS and JaveScript for layout and styling. Grid Layout and positioning concepts were used to accomplish the layouting requirement and JaveScript was used to add the theme switching feature. The challenge involves both desktop and mobile version and this site is based on Mobile First.

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this Social Media Dashboard and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Toggle color theme to their preference

## Where to find everything

The task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design to work to. 

The designs are in JPG static format. This will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. This should help train your eye to perceive differences in spacings and sizes.

If you would like the Sketch file in order to inspect the design in more detail it is available to buy from the challenge page on the platform.

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.
